# 4x4 (Four by Four)
a friend-first space that helps close-knit groups stay connected, plan intentionally, and care for each other in ways that actually feel human. It turns scattered chats, forgotten birthdays, and mental “who likes what again?” lists into one shared home for your friendships.​

## mission statement
4x4’s mission is to help friend groups show up for each other with less friction and more intention by unifying planning, social energy, and personal preferences into a single, respectful shared tool.​

## In practice, 4x4 aims to:

- Make it effortless to create, coordinate, and remember plans across a consistent circle of friends, so hanging out becomes easier than canceling.​

- Reduce social burnout and guilt by giving friends a way to share their “social battery” and boundaries, so plans match how people actually feel.​

- Support meaningful gestures—like the right gift, on the right date, in the right size—by keeping birthdays, sizes, and interests organized and accessible to the people who care.​

## Core principles
- Friendship over metrics: The product optimizes for relationship quality and mutual care, not streaks, likes, or engagement vanity metrics.​

- Consent and privacy: Every piece of personal info (energy status, sizes, preferences) is shared intentionally, with clear controls over who sees what.​

- Low-friction logistics: Planning, reminders, and data entry are designed to be “set once, benefit often,” respecting that adults have limited time and attention.​

## “Friends by friends” framing
- Built for stable circles, not for endless follower counts; the app assumes small groups matter most.​

- Designed so that each friend’s profile is a living reference—plans, gifts, sizes, and soft preferences all in one place—curated collaboratively by the people who know them best.​
